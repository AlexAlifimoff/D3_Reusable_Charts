An implementation of a reusable responsive violin chart.

Based on the concept outlined in Mike Bostocks blog post [Towards Reusable Charts](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/chart/).
Also based on [Violin/Box plots](http://bl.ocks.org/z-m-k/5014368)

This script allows for an easy to implement and customize reusable box plot and violin plot. Play around with the options to see some of what is possible using this script.

Open in new window to see the responsive functionality.
